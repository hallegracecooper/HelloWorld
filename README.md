# HelloWorld

# Overview

This project is a simple "Hello World" program written in Python. It is the first step in building my Personal Software Portfolio to demonstrate my skills as a software engineer and further my understanding of version control, development environments, and documentation practices.

The purpose of creating this software is to set up a foundational workflow for developing, documenting, and sharing software projects while learning to use tools like GitHub and Visual Studio Code effectively.
